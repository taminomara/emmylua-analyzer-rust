# Diagnostics

Diagnostics can be suppressed through {emmyrc:obj}`EmmyRc.diagnostics.disable`.
You can also change severity of an individual diagnostic
with {emmyrc:obj}`EmmyRc.diagnostics.severity`.

Some diagnostics are disabled by default. You can re-enable them by adding their codes
to {emmyrc:obj}`EmmyRc.diagnostics.enables`.
